# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. 
# If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is 
# usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
height_int = float(height)
weight_int = float(weight)

bmi = round(weight_int / height_int ** 2)

print(f"Your BMI rating is: {bmi}")
